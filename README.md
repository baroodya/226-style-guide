# COS 226 Style Guide

This style guide is an extention of the COS 126 style guide, written by Alex Baroody, Shayna Maelson, and Erin Vuong. 
You can access that style guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t_3faRPgonwt78eM7tthA_bsjbKy6kn22cLVv4S0Bn0/edit?usp=sharing). 
Please note that, if you can't find a style concept in this guide, it is likely in the COS 126 volume: and, given that COS 126 is a
prerequisite for this class, you are expected to follow those style guidelines. 

In this guide you will find style guidelines relating to the Java topics discussed in this course. Since this is primarily an
Algorithms course and not a Java course, these topics will be less frequent than in COS 126 (and therefore this guide will be smaller 
and updated less often). However, that does not mean that you are any less responsible for the topics covered here. Please check back in
with this guide before starting every assignment, as well as making sure your code has good style before submitting. If there is a topic
that isn't included in this guide that you think should be, please alert us by asking on Ed or emailing the course staff. 

Happy coding!
